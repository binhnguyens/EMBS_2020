% Tutorial 2 for MATLAB

%%%%%% Part 1
%% Set Matrix A and B 
A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9];
B = [9 8 7; 6 5 4; 3 2 1];
disp(A);
disp(B);

%% Find B transpose


%% A * B'


%% Find determinant of A


%% Find A(3,2)


%%%%%% Part 2
%% Frankenstein a Matrix E where:
% The first two columns are the first two columns of A  
% The third column is the second row of B 

% Fill in the below
first_col = 
sec_col =
third_col = 
E = 
disp(E);

%% Inverse of E


%% Sum of matrix E 



%%%%%% Part 3
%% Create a single plot of sin^2 (x) and cos (x^2)
% Solution:
% Our goal in this section is to create two plots on one
% Create your range from 0 to 2 pi with a step of pi/100
% start:step:end

% Answer here

% Creat both the equations y1 and y2
% Must use .^ for exponent since you're

%%%%%% Explaintation of code
% figure - function to open a window so that you can plot stuff
%           If you don't use this function, then if you try to plot new
%           figures, then it'll overlap on the same figure.
% 
% hold on - function that allows the figure to "hold on" so you could   
%           plot multiple different signals on.
% 
% plot - plot something on the figure.
% 
% xlabel and ylabel - to label the axes.
% 
% xlim and ylim - set the limits of the axes. syntax is as follows ([min max])
% 
% legend and title - labelling of legend and title of the figure
